## Target Block (experimental)

Because let's face it, your aim could use some practice

-The closer you hit to the center, the larger the redstone signal!
-You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe
-Added to experimental gameplay until it acts consistently over all platforms

# Mobs
## Piglins
- Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the nether
- They mostly hang around in the crimson forest, but you might find some in the nether wastes too
- They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
- However if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
- Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
- Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
- Gold ingots are currency to Piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an ingot to barter for various goods
- Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt Hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary
- Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
- Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
- Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified Piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
- Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and Piglins will attack on sight
- Baby Piglins are not as dangerous
