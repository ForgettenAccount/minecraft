## Target Block (experimental)

Because let's face it, your aim could use some practice

-You will need one hay block and four redstone for this recipe
-Added to experimental gameplay until it acts consistently over all platforms

# Mobs
## Piglins
- Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the nether
- They mostly hang around in the crimson forest, but you might find some in the nether wastes too
- They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight
- However if you dress appropriately they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least
- Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest, or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly
- Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items
- Gold ingots are currency to Piglins and you can throw ingots at them or right-click them with an ingot to barter for various goods
- Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt Hoglins for food. Or they try at least. They results... vary
- Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups, and when a fight is happening everyone wants in
- Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly
- Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified Piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible
- Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and Piglins will attack on sight
- Baby Piglins are not as dangerous

## Hoglins
- Hoglins are big aggressive beasts that live in crimson forests in the nether
- They attack players on sight, so be careful, they can easily knock you off a ledge!
- Hoglins drop pork chops, but not willingly
- You can breed Hoglins by feeding them crimson fungi, but do so at your own risk
- Hoglins get hunted by Piglins sometimes, but they don't go down without a fight!
- Despite this, Hoglins and Piglin aren't enemies - they are more like an ecosystem
- Baby Hoglins like to pretend they are tough - but don't worry, they are more like angry puppies with no teeth
- Want to keep Hoglins off your back? Pro tip: Hoglins hate the smell of warped fungi!

## Zombified Piglins
- Zombie pigmen are now known as Zombified Piglins, and they now have ears... well, at least one ear

## Netherite
- A new high-level material found in the Nether. Use it to upgrade your diamond gear!

## Netherite effects
- Netherite items float in lava. So you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath
- Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold)
- Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond
- Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond
- Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond
- Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such
- Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and Netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok
- And it looks cool!

## How to make Netherite
- Mine Ancient Debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At own risk. No insurance coverage for that
- Combine 4 Netherite Scrap with 4 Gold Ingots in a crafting table (for now) to make a Netherite Ingot
- Refine it into Netherite Scrap in a furnace or blast furnace

- Despawn Rules have been changed to closely match Java Despawn Rules ([MCPE-21856](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-21856))
  - This change allows mobs to more consistently spawn around the player and improve the frequency of mobs spawning underground while the player is exploring caves, as well as trying to farm areas that spawn specific mobs. (eg. Wither Skeletons, in Nether Fortresses)
    - Any mobs that have been set to persist (tempted, name-tagged, tamed, bred, etc) will never naturally despawn
    - Almost all naturally spawning mobs will automatically despawn when they are 54 blocks or further away from the nearest players
    - Fish automatically despawn at a max range of 40 blocks or further
    - If mobs are between 32 and 54 blocks from the nearest player, they must not take damage for 30 seconds as well as successfully roll a 1 in 800 chance to despawn
  - The Following mobs do not follow these despawn Rules:
    - Wither Boss
    - Ender Dragon
    - Evoker
    - Vindicator
    - Bee
